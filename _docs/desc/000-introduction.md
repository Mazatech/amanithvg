# Introduction

AmanithVG is a commercial implementation of OpenVG 1.1 and 1.0.1, the application programming interface (API) for hardware accelerated 2D vector and raster graphics, created by the Khronos group. Born as a "OpenVG on OpenGL / OpenGL ES" engine, AmanithVG evolved into two different OpenVG graphic libraries.

## AmanithVG GLE

AmanithVG GLE is entirely built on top of OpenGL 1.1+ and OpenGL ES 1.x CM, and it uses extensions where available. This engine can grant high quality vector graphics on a wide range of 3D chipset, achieving better performance than software rasterizers in terms of high resolution animations and complex special effects (transparencies, fading, realtime rotoscaling and many others).

## AmanithVG SRE

AmanithVG SRE is a pure software solution that grants a superlative vector graphics quality without to sacrifice performance on any kind of architecture / platform. Thanks to its original polygon rasterization algorithm and dedicated optimized scanline fillers, this engine constitutes the fastest OpenVG software rendering solution available on the market.
