[AmanithVG](http://mazatech.com/amanithvg) is a 2D vector graphics library that implements [OpenVG 1.1](https://www.khronos.org/openvg/): the standard, royalty-free, cross-platform API for hardware accelerated 2D vector and raster graphics, created by [Khronos group](https://www.khronos.org); AmanithVG comes with two different rendering backends: SRE (pure software) and GLE (OpenGL\|ES aided) in order to provide the highest rendering quality at top speed on any device.  
The library is witten in ANSI C and depends on a very limited set of standard libc functions, that can be easily mapped to custom functions, to be portable even on bare metal platforms.

The AmanithVG SDK includes:

* Library (bin) for:
	* Desktop (Win, OS X, Linux) on: x86, x86\_64
	* Mobile (iOS, Android, Linux, QNX) on: arm, armv7, aarch64, ppc, mips
* Tiger example (bin+src) for:
	* Desktop (Win, OS X, Linux) on: x86, x86\_64
	* Mobile (iOS, Android, Linux, QNX) on: arm, armv7, aarch64, ppc, mips
